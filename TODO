===================
=== Zomby TODOs ===


>>> Runtime <<<

*) Figure out how to support embedded images etc. -- data: URIs should work except in IE

*) VML-based views for all shapes to support IE

*) Loading mechanism - AJAX to load the data

*) When updating views, avoid modifying SVG attributes/elements if they haven't changed since the last update --
   need some sort of local property cache to compare against?

*) Work to make JSON serialization as succinct as possible -- omit properties that don't need to be serialized, like
   those that match the default values for their ModelObject.

*) Customize the JSON parser so that it assembles objects as their data streams in; this is necessary to support the
   movie starting to play before all the data has downloaded, loading progress bar scripts, etc.

*) ForeignObject support so complex content e.g. HTML can be loaded as a shape
